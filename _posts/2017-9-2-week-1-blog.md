#### What are my expectations of the class?

My biggest expectation from this class is that adapting to learn new technology tools and languages by myself. I think in this ever changing tech world having the skills to learn new tools without the help of other people is crucial. In my past internship this summer I frequently found myself having a hard time trying to use tools that I don't know. Hopefully I will get enough experience from this class that I know how to use vm environments, continuous integration and some test driven development.


#### What did I do this past week?

This past week was the first week of school. As every other first week goes it was very light and fun. I got to hangout with some old friends and exchange some stories with each other. I started practicing for the tech interviews since internship applications have already started to open.  


#### What's in my way?

Only myself. Procrastination and laziness are the only things that hold me back. 


#### What will I do next week?

I hope its going to be another standard week of classes. I plan to practice interview questions every single day as the career fair comes closer. Also I'm in the process of taking the GRE test for grad school in the next couple weeks so I'm trying to do some practice problems for that test as well. Luckily quantitative part is not hard so I only need to practice for the verbal. Of course being a non native speaker hurts my chances of doing well in the test but I believe I practiced enough to do well. 


#### What's my experience of the class?

It's an easy to follow class in which lectures are not very intense so far. Dr. Downing manages to keep everyone's attention to the lectures by asking questions to students and writing notes to an empty file instead of having slides. It feels like it is going to involve a lot of self learning since even creating this blog page took me an hour of learning and implementing.  


#### Pick of the week

While writing this blog in vim I learned that vim has a builtin spellchecker. You just have to do :setlocal spell and every misspelled word is highlighted with red.
